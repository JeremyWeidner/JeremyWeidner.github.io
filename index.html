<h3>About Me:</h3>
<p>I am a senior at <a href = "https://www.ucdavis.edu/about">UC Davis</a> studying Statistics and Economics. I am currently building up knowledge in the area of data and web technology by pursuing projects through school and in my free time. I expect to be graduating Fall of 2017 with my double major in Economics and Statistics. I am comfortable doing data and web related programming in both <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python</a> and <a href="https://cran.r-project.org/">R</a> and also have knowledge in HTML and SQL.<br></p>
